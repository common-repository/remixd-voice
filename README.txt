Give your users the ability to listen to your written content, on site, while also generating incremental revenue.

== Description ==

Transform your written content into audio files in a fully automated fashion to delight your users and make your content more portable and accessible. Our lightweight integration and lifelike voices will enable you to create a deeper and more personal connection with your audience.

#### PREMIUM VOICE EXPERIENCE

Remixd’s proprietary technology utilizes the latest AI to convert written articles into playable stories, ensuring the most pleasing audio experience possible. With multiple voices to choose from, you control how your audience will experience your content when listening.

#### INCREASE TIME ON SITE

The introduction of audio articles will benefit a number of editorial KPIs. Listeners tend to stay longer, which reduces bounce rate, increases domain authority, and leads to higher overall engagement with your content.

#### IMPROVE ACCESSIBILITY

Make it easier for those with visual impairments and learning disabilities to consume your content, and create alternatives for mobile users who may not find reading convenient at a particular moment. 

#### INCREMENTAL REVENUE

Audio is booming. Take advantage of the flood of advertiser interest with our built in monetization solution. Every placement is assessed for brand safety and once approved there are no additional items needed to begin generating revenue on your audio content.

#### EASY SETUP

Our goal is to make setup fast, easy, and painless so you can focus on creating amazing content. Once we’re configured, audio content creation happens in a totally automated fashion.
